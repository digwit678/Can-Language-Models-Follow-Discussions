        "\n",
        "**Input:** Two claims originating from the same discussion.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "### Multi-level Consecutiveness\n",

        "\n",
        "### Base Claim Context\n",
        "Incorporating the base claim as context could either simplify or complicate the task, depending on the model's effectiveness in utilizing it."
